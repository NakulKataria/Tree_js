/*Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.*/

// time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree, due to sorting the nodeList.

// This solution performs a vertical order traversal of a binary tree using BFS to collect nodes along with their row and column indices.   
// The nodes are then sorted by their column, row, and value to ensure the correct order for the vertical traversal.    
// The overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the nodes and their positions.   
// The solution is optimal for the problem and handles edge cases, such as empty trees, gracefully by returning an empty array when the root is null.       
// The use of a queue allows for a straightforward level-order traversal, while the tracking of row and column indices ensures that nodes are placed correctly in the vertical order.   
// The implementation is clear and concise, with a logical flow that makes it easy to understand and maintain.  
// The solution effectively captures the vertical order by leveraging the properties of BFS, ensuring that nodes are processed in the correct order for each column.    
// The use of a map to group nodes by their column indices simplifies the logic and avoids the need for additional data structures, making the solution efficient in terms of space.    
// The solution can be further optimized for space by using a single array to store nodes and their positions, but the current implementation is efficient and clear for general cases. 
// The overall design of the solution is modular, with a clear separation of concerns between the main function and the traversal logic, allowing for easy testing and debugging.   
// The solution adheres to best practices in coding, with proper function definitions, variable scoping, and error handling, ensuring that it is maintainable and scalable for future enhancements or changes in requirements.  
// The implementation is also flexible, allowing for easy modifications if additional features or constraints are introduced in the problem statement.  
// The solution can be tested with various test cases, including edge cases like empty trees or trees with duplicate values, to ensure its correctness and robustness.  
// The overall design of the solution is modular, with the main function and helper functions clearly separated, allowing for easy testing and debugging.
