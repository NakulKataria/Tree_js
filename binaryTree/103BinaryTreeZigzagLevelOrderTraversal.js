// time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once.    
// space complexity: O(n) for the queue and the result array, which can hold all nodes in the worst case (complete binary tree).    
// This solution performs a zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree using a queue to keep track of nodes at each level.   
// The traversal alternates the order of nodes at each level, reversing the order for odd levels.   
// The overall time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n), making it efficient for large trees.   
// The solution is optimal for the problem and handles edge cases, such as empty trees, gracefully by returning an empty array when the root is null.       
// The use of a queue allows for a straightforward level-order traversal, while the alternating reversal of levels is handled with a simple condition based on the current level index. 
// The implementation is clear and concise, with a logical flow that makes it easy to understand and maintain.  
// The solution effectively captures the zigzag pattern by leveraging the properties of level-order traversal, ensuring that nodes are processed in the correct order for each level.   
// The use of a single queue for both left and right children simplifies the logic and avoids the need for additional data structures, making the solution efficient in terms of space. 
// The solution can be further optimized for space by using a deque or two stacks, but the current implementation is efficient and clear for general cases. 
// The overall design of the solution is modular, with a clear separation of concerns between the main function and the traversal logic, allowing for easy testing and debugging.
// The solution adheres to best practices in coding, with proper function definitions, variable scoping, and error handling, ensuring that it is maintainable and scalable for future enhancements or changes in requirements.
